            <h4><p>CrisisWear is a security button device in the form of 
            accessories like bracelets, necklaces, keychains, etc. They can 
            be activated when the button on the side of the main surface is 
            pushed twice consecutively. Then, you would be able to push the 
            button a certain number of times depending on your current 
            situation. For this product, one push signals an armed attacker and
            two pushes are for when the user is unsure of the situation. This
            would allow the police to be alerted of the situation you are in 
            and where you are. It would also let the police plan out how to arrive to
            the scene and how to handle the situation. For example, if it was a 
            school shooting, the police would want to arrive discreetly, whereas
            if a robbery is in progress, it might be different. The key/legend 
            of how many times you should push the button for each circumstance 
            would be engraved into the keychain/pendant. The device would 
            connect to your phone and send a message to the nearest police 
            department and send the coordinates of the device to them as well 
            through the GPS feature.</p></h4>

          <h4><p>We were first inspired to make CrisisWear when we looked through 
          a document listing problems in the world ranging from local to global. 
          We noticed how a lot of people thought that public 
          crimes such as school shootings or bank robberies were a rising 
          problem in the world today. Although we were not able to think of a 
          realistic way to prevent these crimes, we realized that we could do 
          something about how quickly and strategically the police and/or 
          paramedics arrive at the scene after these kinds of situations. For 
          example, in the Florida school shooting this February, the fire alarm 
          was set off, making it easier for the shooter to do harm since 
          everyone was outside in one big group. The police were most likely 
          misinformed about the situation and had the materials and backup to 
          handle a fire, not a school shooting. This was the inspiration behind 
          our idea to make sure that the owner of our device could alert the 
          police department on the situation taking place and the location 
          so that they would be better equipped to handle it. In addition, we 
          wanted our device to come in the form of accessories to make them 
          blend in and portable.</p></h4>
