            <h4><p>CrisisWear is a device in the form of accessories like bracelets, 
            necklaces, keychains, and etc., that can be activated when a button 
            on the side of it is pushed five times consecutively. Then, you 
            would be able to push the button again a certain number of times 
            depending on your current situation. For example, one push signals 
            a shooting, two indicates a robbery, and etc. This would allow the 
            police to not only be alerted of your condition quickly, but it 
            would also let the police plan out how to arrive at the scene and 
            how to handle the situation. For example, if it was a school 
            shooting, the police would want to arrive quietly and discreetly, 
            whereas after a robbery has occurred, it would not matter how quiet 
            or loud the police was. The key/legend of how many times you should 
            push the button for each circumstance would be given to you when you 
            receive the product and you could memorize it, attatch it to your 
            ID badge, store it in your pocket, and more.</p></h4>

          <h4><p>We were first inspired to make CrisisWear when we looked through 
          a document listing problems in the world ranging from local to global. 
          We noticed how a lot of people thought that public 
          crimes such as school shootings or bank robberies were a rising 
          problem in the world today. Although we were not able to think of a 
          realistic way to prevent these crimes, we realized that we could do 
          something about how quickly and strategically the police and/or 
          paramedics arrive at the scene after these kinds of situations. For 
          example, in the Florida school shooting this February, the fire alarm 
          was set off, making it easier for the shooter to do harm since 
          everyone was outside in one big group. The police were most likely 
          misinformed about the situation and had the materials and backup to 
          handle a fire, not a school shooting. This was the inspiration behind 
          our idea to make sure that the owner of our device could alert the 
          police department on the situation taking place so that they would 
          be better equipped to handle it. In addition, we wanted our device 
          to come in the form of accessories so that they would blend in, be 
          portable, and look fashionable.</p></h4>
